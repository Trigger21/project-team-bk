"I've got ~NW15 normal/dry skin and this stuff is great and about ~$8 on amazon. Wears well under makeup and no white cast  "
"+1"
"Literally wearing this on my face right now. I'm on my first bottle, and I've been using it for a few weeks. It has zero white cast and mattifies my skin enough to keep oil under control while not drying out my skin. "
"I recommend this to anyone who is concerned about white cast, especially people with medium to dark skin tones. I actually decided to buy this after reading a review on Amazon from a black woman who praised its zero white cast. "
"Do you have acne prone skin? Every sunscreen I work breaks me out."
"Sounds like an ingredient sensitivity, so maybe it'd be good to start keeping ingredient lists of things that do and don't work for you. If you're just sensitive to one sunscreen active ingredient, then you can look for one that doesn't include that one."
"I do have acne-prone skin, but this sunscreen doesn't break me out."
"yes! another +1. this is one of the only sunscreens i've re-purchased, and i'm now on my 3rd or 4th bottle probably. i have dry, sensitive, breakout prone skin and have had no issues with it. it can actually help add a dewy glow to my skin (which is something i aim for with my skincare). it's a great alternative for the biore watery essence since it contains less alcohol and should therefore play nicer with dry/sensitive/reactive skin types."
"This stuff is genuinely better than an primer I've tried in terms of smoothing my skin. I've used it for over a year and love it."
"Do you know if this is physical or chemical?"
"Definitely chemical."
"Thank you!"
"I think chemical "
"This is my HG. It's awesome under makeup."
"NC25 acne-prone/combo and I've been using this sunscreen for over 2 weeks now <U+2014> I LOVE it mainly because of the low alcohol content not irritating my skin. I used to use Biore Watery Essence and as lovely as it was under my makeup it kept breaking me out because of the high alcohol content."
"I second this! I used this for a long time because it was so affordable and sits extremely well under makeup. A lot of people will just use this sunscreen and skip primer. "
"Did you switch to something else you like better? If so what? Thx! "
"Yes! I've switched to Kicho Ultra Moisturizing Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA+++! I found this through kbeauty websites like Ohlolly and Peach & Lily. I like this Kicho cream because it's a 2-in-1, moisturizer and sunblock. I like the Shiseido Senka, but I have to use a separate moisturizer underneath. Using the Kicho just cuts down on time for my morning routine. :) "
"When you say white cast, that means the flashback from the camera or the sunblock leaving your skin a bit lighter?"
"The sunblock leaving your skin lighter. Not sure about flashback, I wear foundations with and without SPF over it and don't take too many flash photos "
"I looked on the Shiseido website and it was not listed, but I found the Amazon listing that was mentioned and it doesn't seem to be from the actual Shiseido brand, for anyone trying to find it and getting confused like me haha."
"Hm. The label is entirely in Japanese so were you looking on the US shiseido website? "
"Do you know if they're still shipping these to the US? I heard that japanese sunscreens were being turned back at customs because of the alcohol content or maybe something about ingredients not yet approved for use. I really want to try this though!"
"I got mine off of Amazon from Japan about a month ago with no problem "
"Im so happy to hear this! Ordering mine now. Will report back in several months when it either arrives or doesn't."
"Oh whatup fellow NW15! Also I'm very excited to check this product out. "
"MAC NC35
Combo skin - fairs a bit on the drier side as of late.
Just trying to provide sun protection for my skin. "
"Recommendations: Anything from Biore's Japanese line of skincare. Not too much flashback, no offensive scent, not too chalky, and really great performance. Also love to use a Vitamin C serum with Ferulic Acid to really lock in that sun protection. I think asian skincare is the way to go with sunblock, and biore's japanese skincare line has some really, really wonderful options! "
"Have you tried Shiseido's Senka sunscreen? Do you know how it compares to Biore?"
"Hey there! I have not had a chance to try that one yet, but I do plan on it. I picked up a few new ones (KAO Biore UV Perfect Face milk sun cut and Hada Labo Gokujyn Perfect UV Gel) so I'm waiting to finish those before I pick up the Shiseido because I've heard really great things about it. I have tried the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essense Sunscreen and another one by Biore whose name escapes me right now, but they are really nice. I think the Biore one is definitely more popular than the Shiseido one, so that is the one I'd recommend going with. It has a ton of reviews and is most commonly purchased from my research."
"I have! I have normal/dry sensitive skin. They performed the same for me- no adverse side effects with either, BUT Biore is scented. I prefer non scented makeup so I go for Shiseido Senka now. "
"Thank you!!"
"hey, I can answer this a little bit more fully.  I use both Shiesedo Senka and Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, depending on where i am on the rosacea flare cycle.  I love the feel of the Biore, it's creamy and light and goes on so so so very smooth, but it is scented and has a lot of alcohol so i find it to be somewhat drying and irritating on my skin.  If i'm not in a flare cycle i can tolerate it, but if i am... I use the Shiesado.  if it had the same texture as the Biore, it would be absolutely perfect.  it's not scented, low alcohol, my skin LOVES this stuff.  i think it has a bit more flashback than the Biore, but it's comparable."
"I want to try Asian sunscreen but I'm so weary of the high amounts of alcohol. My skin is so sensitive."
"I did just buy some Rohto skin aqua UV moisture milk PA+++ which is both alcohol and fragrance free so I'm hoping it works for me!"
"I think I just picked up this one too so I'm excited to give it a try! I absolutely understand where you are coming from with the concerns over the ingredients. Overall I have enjoyed the ones that I have tried and they didn't break me out, so it's worth giving them a try? I've heard wonderful things about the Shiseido US line of sunscreen as well!"
"Which one did you get? If it's in pink it's the one I'm using haha. But the moisture milk is really nice, it's lightweight and decently moisturizing for my dry skin and I live in a humid climate, dries to a satin finish in about 15 minutes, since it's a chemical/physical or combo sunscreen I usually wait at least 20 minutes for it to set so it doesn't move around :) ah, and as someone with dry cheeks and normal t zone, do NOT get the biore milks they are WAY too drying, yes it dries in like a minute or two but Its wayyyy too stripping for an everyday basis........ Also The biore Nobi milk and the sunkiller perfect strong moisture milk might be something worth looking into :) I also use alcohol free sunscreens especially on my cheeks. "
"I actually bought the one in the blue bottle haha. I will definitely keep all that in mind, thank you so much! And yes, I've heard the biore is super drying and it just seems like too much alcohol for everyday use."
"I've used both the blue and the pink ones hut they were both made in China where I bought them in my local drugstore. Another one that I think I discontinued is the skin aqua Uv whitening milk that one was made in Japan. The former 2 is VERY liquidy when compared to latter which is more or a creamier texture. Sadly, the Japan-made skin aqua moisture milk in the blue bottle is discontinued and replaced with a super moisture milk in the golden bottle. Ooh but it's pa++++ and sweat resistant!
I'm actually in a dilemma right now. I'm leaving for uni next year and the place I'm gonna be at is super humid hot and muggy. I'm gonna use a moisturizing sunscreen that's a bit sweat-resistant (sunkiller strong moisture ) for my cheeks and for my normal t zone I'm contemplating on whether I should get the biore Nobi milk (which is sweat resistant and alcohol free!) or the sunkiller perfect strong plus that's also sweat resistant but has alcohol. TT"
"The biore waterproof one (in the blue container doesn't have alcohol! Although it does leave a slight whitecast"
"Where do you buy the Biore sunscreen from?"
"ebay or amazon both carry it. if you're lucky and you ask the seller, i've had some on ebay who will actually share the receipt of the product to validate its purchase date and that it is authentic. "
"Oh okay. I'm always scared to buy a fake product on there. Hmm, looks like I will have to research and find a good seller!"
"Oh yeah I know what you mean! I was really concerned about that too when I first started looking, but just look for a promising seller and if you can get them to give you a copy of a receipt that helps too. For the most part I've heard very little about fakes of the biore sunscreens (i could be completely wrong here) compared to other products like the cure cleansing gel so you should be fine. :)"
"Okay, good to know! Thanks so much for the help! "
"Any time! :D "
"So I had to come back and tell you thank you so much for recommending this sunscreen because it's pretty freaking amazing!! I'm officially hooked!! It's the perfect texture, especially for the Texas heat and just melts into my oily skin and I don't feel like an oil slick when I have to apply my makeup on top of it! <f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0089>"
"I'm so glad you loved it! Enjoy! It's one of my personal favs :)"
"also, i know amazon's review system is pretty good/solid compared to ebay's, so that might be a better route? "
"What's the benefit for using vit c and sunscreen together? "
"Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant and can therefore ""boost"" your sunscreen. Certain sunscreen ingredients and UV rays itself  produce free radicals and vitamin c can neutralise them. It can also help prevent sunburn. "
"Not sunscreen related but it also helps producing collagen, so your skin can look younger and it can improve akne scars and other discolorations. "
"vit-c brightens the skin. it looks great under foundations or as is. over time it gives beautiful luminosity and glow. some of the ones i have used give me an immediate radiance which i love - nothing in your face, but very subtle. over time it will help to fade discoloration on your face too. i heard that ferulic acid, which i have commonly seen mixed with vit-c can, also help to serve as a ""sunscreen."" i believe it has something to do with free radicals and it helps to reverse sun damage and protect the skin from enduring any more. people swear by it and it has a lot of great research behind it. "
"sunscreen is more of a physical block (and you can find ones that have chemical blocks in them too!) to prevent any harmful rays from hitting your skin directly, whereas the ferulic acid is serving as a second line of defense to protect the skin against other harmful effects courtesy of the sun that might get through your sunscreen and reversing any damage that is already there. "
"What  Vitamin c do you love?"
"I've tried a few different ones but I really love the Timeless Skin Care 20% Vitamin C Plus E Ferulic Acid Serum which you can get on Amazon. Hands down my favorite. I think the price is fair and it does exactly what I need it to so I'm very happy with it. "
"Japanese sunscreens without alcohol are great for people who have dry, sensitive skin! The downside is that they take a lot longer to absorb (15-20 minutes) than sunscreens with alcohol. They typically dry to a satin finish. "
"My two favorites are the Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel and the Mommy! UV Gel (the bottle is bear shaped!!!). These do not leave any sort of white cast on my NC25-30 skin :)"
"You know I was wondering about this in another thread about Japanese sunscreens w/o alcohol and I would love to try some. "
"But for what I'm using to contribute to thread: I'm using super goop serum (marshalls at like 15$ last time I checked?your marshals might have it) and I've had severe cystic acne in the past and my skin is pretty acne prone and sensitive but it doesnt break me out and I use it daily but I would not recommend it as it is creamy/oily but ymmv and I'm trying to change my sunscreen to something lighter."
"Where did you buy canmake "
"I purchased mine on Amazon "
"MAC NW50 with combo/oily skin. Currently my face and neck are darker than the rest of my body so I'm trying to reverse or at least prevent further darkening, plus I use actives at night."
"Biore Watery Essence really is as good as they say it is ya'll. No flashback, no white cast, and it offers great protection. The only thing is that there's a ton of alcohol in it, but it doesn't have a negative impact on my skin. Oh and there's fragrance too, it's a soft citrusy scent. It absorbs well, dries down quickly, wears well under makeup, and doesn't make me any oilier. It's def HG for me."
"EDIT: I'm talking about the older 2015 formulation, not the 2017 one."
"I loved the first bottle of biore watery essence I bought but unfortunately they've reformulated just this past month or so to make it water resistant. It's much heavier and greasier than before :((( "
"Ugh, yeah I've heard. I'm trying to stock up on bottles of the old formula before they go away for good."
"Do you find that the fragrance lingers even after application?"
"Nope not at all!"
"While we're on this topic, how many of you are actually putting on the recommended 1/4 tsp? I tried doing this for a while - actually measuring it with a spoon - it's A LOT... I felt like it took forever to dry and messed up my makeup."
"There was a post by someone on SCA or AB (can't find it unfortunately) and the recommended amount is actually for men in the 95th percentile of face size! So if you are a woman with an average sized face you do need less sunscreen for it to be effective. "
"I do, and it's why I use Elta MD UV Clear. It's not necessarily the best sunscreen of all time (it will leave your face shiny if you wear it alone), but it works well under makeup and it's the only sunscreen (especially physical) that I can stand having 1/4 tsp of on my face. It doesn't get weird or seem like a thick mask when used in that quantity. "
"I do, but I use Japanese sunscreen with a lot of alcohol in it which makes it dry down faster. It works great for me, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with alcohol sensitivities!"
"I keep a 1/4 tsp measurer next to my sunscreen just for this! I use it everyday to make sure I get the right amount. It takes a little longer to rub that much in, but waiting 15 minutes for it to absorb usually makes it dry down before my makeup. "
"I tried it and it was just too much all at once so I aim for ~almost 1/4 tsp or sometimes I do one layer and go in again after it dries down some"
"Nc10-15 (maybelline fit me matte + poreless 110 is a good match). "
"Dry / normal combo. "
"I personally don't make a lot of flash pictures. So no idea on the flash back. The biggest goal for me in a good sun screen is keeping my face from getting sunburned without getting greasy.
Which it does. My skin is sensitive and burns very easily. "

"I have pretty much the same concerns as you and I also use the Paula's choice. I have combo skin though so if I don't wear foundation over top, or atleast powder then it looks pretty greasy. I'm nc10 and don't get a white cast, once it's absorbed. I don't have a problem with using it under any of my foundations (too faced btw, mac waterproof nourishing, mac studio fix liquid, studio fix powder, tarte rainforest of the sea, or mufe hd)."
"I've been wanting to try the anthelios for awhile, just been worried it would irritate my skin because of the chemical  not physical spf. I guess there has to be a bit of a trade off if I want heavy duty waterproof spf, atleast for summer. I wish Paula's choice came in a higher spf or was waterproof."
"I only use the Anthelios for the heavy summer and the chemical spf isn't awesome but holds up in hot humid weather when sunprotection is my first concern."
"My skin type: very dry, sensitive. My skin colour is on the lighter side of drugstore, so not really pale but light."
"Missha safe block essence sun spf 45/PA+++"
"A nice, light sunscreen with little alcohol. I hardly wear it in the winter, since it's too light but I like it for the summer. I'm sensitive to perfume but this one doesn't cause any problems. It's all chemical and therefore no whitecast. It works well as a primer under make up.  Another plus, it's just 9€ at ebay. "
"Suncover SPF 30 from uncover cosmetics"
"This sunscreen is great for dry. It's more moisturising than the missha one but it sinks in great. It leaves a healthy glowy/dewy finish, I don't think it's too shiny. The formulation is mild, without fragrance and alcohol. It's also all chemical."
"Biosolis Face and Body Sunscreen SPF 30"
"My favorite mineral sunscreen. It does leave a whitecast but it works well with make up.For me it's still wearable, despite the whitecast. It's rich and nice for really dry skin. Unfortunately it's pricey but for me one of the best organic sunscreen. "
"I'm sensitive to sunscreens and the Missha safe block with the pink packaging is really great for me. I don't think i'll be switching away from it "
"I have read about Uncover's sunscreen multiple times here. Do you know how we can buy it from the US?"
"I'm not sure if they ship outside of europe yet, since the company is quite new and based in europe. They also use filters which aren't FDA-approved. You could message them, maybe they can help you out."
"Thank you for the info!"
"I can only use physical sunscreens so here are my favorites:"
"I'm NC15 and I have dry skin and need good sun protection because I have fair skin and live in a country with harsh UV rays so skin cancer is a concern for me."
"Bare minerals Prep step Mineral daily shield - serously this is so underrated. It has a silky smooth texture and smooths your pores. It dries quickly and I haven't noticed a flashback with it. It's also spf 50. I think it's comparable to Japanese sunscreen textures, but I wouldn't know for sure because most Japanese sunscreens are chemical and I can't use them."
"Bare minerals tinted Bb primer is also a really good one - it has a similar texture to the mineral daily shield but has a slight tint which offers light coverage. On days I don't want to wear foundation I wear this and it's excellent for that. It's spf 30. Everytime I use this primer I notice my skin looks extra smooth and blurred, I never believed in the magic of primers before I bought this and now I'm a primer junkie."
"Josie Maran argan daily moisturizer spf 47 - this is great for days when I need extra moisture, but I've found it only helps for dryness if I use a moisturizer underneath it. If I use it alone my skin feels tight underneath. But combined with a moisturizer it's great."
"Supergoop CC cream - this is also really nice for no makeup days. It's tinted and offers light coverage.The SPF varies from 45-50 depending on the shade."
"I know everyone on here is crazy about Japanese sunscreens, but I want to recommend something else just to switch it up.   "
"My absolute favorite facial sunscreen is the Neutrogena Pure & Free Liquid. It's a physical sunscreen rather than chemical, which is a plus for me. I'm about NC15-20 and it does leave a slight white cast for a moment before it sinks in. I imagine if you're darker skinned, it might be more noticeable, but for me it's not a dealbreaker.   "
"It wears very well under makeup. I have combination oily skin and I use the following foundations: Benefit Hello Flawless Powder, Nyx BB Cream, Laura Mercier Oil-Free Tinted Moisturizer, and Maybelline Matte & Poreless. The sunscreen actually helps keep me matte both with and without makeup.   "
"This stuff is seriously great and you can get it at drugstores and Ulta. It's $12.99 for 1.4 oz, which might be pricey for some, but one bottle has lasted me over a year and is still going strong. I use it a few times a week. I haven't had a sunburn since I started using it.  "
"Edit: not sure about flashback, sorry, but I don't think I've noticed it."
"Given how long it's lasted you, I don't think you're applying enough. A lot of sunscreens can seem pretty good when applied so sparingly. I've purchased that particular sunscreen and I find it extremely heavy, difficult to wash off and it leaves an obvious white cast. "
"I'm not targeting you specifically, it's more of a general PSA that people should be wearing more sunscreen than they do. For reference, a 1.7oz bottle of the facial sunscreen I buy lasts me about 5 weeks. "
"Thanks for the comment and PSA!  "
"But like I said, I haven't burned once since I started using this sunscreen, so I'm pretty sure I'm using enough. I usually burn really easily. I probably use about 1/4 tsp for my face. I didn't use it much (or at all) during winter which could be part of why it's lasted so long.  "
"I do appreciate the advice. Can't hurt to use more! "
"[deleted]"
"Not op but it's not fragranced. "
"[deleted]"
"It has a slight smell (maybe the zinc) but it's not very noticeable and it definitely doesn't have that traditional sunscreen smell. "
"I've used this sunscreen! It is kind of drying/mattifying for me (combo/oily skin). It wore well under makeup, but I would spray moisturizing mist on top of the sunscreen to help foundation blend better. "
"It did give me some congested skin from the high concentration of titanium dioxide but it was so good for days when I was outside in the summer. "
"I ordered the Boire Watery Essence from amazon a while back and it's HG for my oily skin. I don't have anything to add that others haven't already mentioned, but I do have a question:"
"Where can I buy this that doesn't take literally 2 months to arrive? I'm running out and it takes forever to ship from Japan to the US :("
"Unfortunately a lot of the Asian sunscreens cannot be sold within the US since they contain ingredients that aren't approved by the FDA yet. My recommendation is to order in bulk a few times a year. The wait sucks. :/"
"Missha perfect sunblock SPF 45
Innisfree sunblock SPF 50"
"You can find both on amazon prime! "
"Are those scented? I like Japanese sunscreens a lot, but biore is so strongly scented I've switched back to Shiseido Senka for the time being. I have other innisfree products that are SUPER scented, so now I'm cautious, but I'd love to try out some more Korean products. "
"The missha has a floral scent. The scent is lighter than the innisfree scent."
"Thanks so much!"
"The biore ones have rose scented ones like the biore face milk and the watery essence but mostly it's fragrance free like the perfect face milk or face milk"
"Great to know! Yes I've used the watery essence, so that makes sense. "
"Yup! And also keep in mind it's not sweat or water resistant. The newly formulated one is, has fragrance too I think but I'm not sure how volatile, tune in to AsianBeauty for reviews I guess^"
"Which color cap on the Missha?"
"Silver! "
"The Cane + Austin Protect Ultra Sheer Weightless sunscreen 50+! No white cast and blends super easily! It also doesn't affect my wear time either and I have oily skin!"
"Olay complete defence spf 30+. I'm fair neutral, normal skin (neither dry nor oily) and just looking for basic sun protection. No flashback and it sits well under makeup. "
"I'm an NC20 with combo (oily T zone, dry cheeks) skin and I've been using the Aveeno Protect + Hydrate Sunscreen for Face & Body in SPF 45. "
"I would have gotten higher SPF (they have 60 and 50) if they had some in store but I'm fine with what I got. No flashback. A little greasy when applying but it will settle down to a natural finish. Works really well under makeup! Really recommend since it's affordable and easy to find in drugstores."
"Not really looking to tan, but I just really don't want to suffer from burning when summer comes around. I wouldn't mind some colour though."
"Sephora Collection has a sunscreen that gives a matte finish which I like as an oily girl. It is their 8 hr mattifying moisturizer broad spectrum, and it's good for sensitive skin and has antioxidants and vitamins. I had tried some other sunscreen which broke me out so I went back to this and had no issues. For some reason on their app it says it is only available online but I have seen it and multiple sephoras."
"La Roche Posay Antihelios Ultra Fluid Lotion is really great. It wears well under makeup, sinks into the skin quickly, and doesn't leave a white cast or feel greasy on the skin. I'm around NC20-25, but I think all skin tones could use this since it really just disappears into the skin."
"I break out from a lot of sunscreens, but this one has worked well for me so far. I have combo skin that is acne-prone. It does contain alcohol, in case you're sensitive to that."
"I'll second this! I'm also NC20-25 though... the tint is visible enough that it works to tone down my redness (from rosacea) enough that I often go without foundation when I wear it... but it works under makeup really well.  "
"I love how it applies so quickly without any greasy feeling. My biggest skin concern is rosacea and avoiding any irritants that can make it worse and I haven't noticed any irritation from the alcohol or other ingredients at all."
"I really like the Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen! I am NC15 with normal/oily skin. I find that this sunscreen does really help with my pores and it goes great under makeup! I just wish it wasn't so expensive and was at least spf 50"
"Shiseido Wetforce 50+ Sunscreen (blue bottle)"
"PROS: doubles as the best primer ive ever used, keeps my skin pretty balanced (not too matte, doesnt get greasy), sinks in pretty quickly, is a physical SPF"
"CONS: pretty strong white cast when first applied but im pale enough that it does sink in and go away pretty quickly, is $40 for 3oz, and i just read that the sunscreen becomes more effective when exposed to water for 15 minutes which now makes me nervous that it's not actually 50+ SPF??, also while it prevents my foundation from breaking up on my cheeks and around my mouth, it causes my foundation to pill on my chin"
"Skin Aqua (from Japan). I get it on amazon, and it wears like a moisturizer. It's the only sunscreen I have ever used that doesn't burn my eyes. I feel giddy just thinking about it!"
"The SPF50+ from DM's own Sundance line, the one in the orange squeeze tube! Admittedly, it doesn't wear nicely at all, it's got the white, greasy mask effect that we all despise in Western sunscreens, but damn me if it doesn't make me notice a difference after taking it off in the evening! It's one of those sunscreens where you can really tell that your skin is being protected, and it even has an IR-A protection system, which is pretty novel for a drugstore chain brand. I wear it at home all the time (unblotted), or when I don't care who sees me (blotted with a cushion puff, then dusted with coloured face powder)."
"For more important occasions I love Biore, they really do produce the most cosmetically elegant sunscreens! I've tried both the Aqua Rich Gel and Essence, and although both were kind of exactly the same thing, I liked the Essence better (although it's pricier); currently I'm using the 40ml Perfect Milk in the violet tube (it's quite okay, longer-lasting than the Aqua Rich line), and I'll be making my way to the Perfect Face Milk in the white packaging next. All of them do have a high alcohol content, but they're very nice if you can wear them on your skin!"
"For my UK peeps: Boots Soltan Dry Touch Face is the bomb. I'm about NC15 and combo-oily in the summer and I use the SPF30 version. I love the texture of it. Sinks into your skin with no greasy feeling at all, but has a slightly tacky finish which means it keeps my makeup on all through a hot summer day! Plus it's like ￡6. Love. Only thing I can't comment on is flashback, I don't really tend to take photos. "
"My favorite is the Algenist SUBLIME DEFENSE Ultra Lightweight UV Defense Fluid SPF 50."
"Really nice lightweight, luminous formula with a little bit of a lavender tint for brightening. "

"Which moisturizer do you use around your mouth at night? I have the same problem and haven't found a good one."
"Skin Type - Combination/oily"
"Skin Tone - Light/medium warm. L'Oreal Infallible Total Cover in 21 Golden Sand is my closest match."
"Recommendation - Clarins Sun Wrinkle Control Cream for Face SPF50+"
"I was so worried about using sunscreen having oily skin, but it sits so beautifully under makeup and doesn't leave me feeling greasy or oily at all. If you're oily or prone to breakouts, I'd definitely recommend giving this a go."
"All Around Safe Block Aqua Sun Gel SPF50+/PA+++"
"NC20ish (NARS Tinted Moisturizer in Alaska and Clinique Even Better in Cream Chamois) "
"Normal dehydrated skin"
"No flashback "
"Gives a nice dewy appearance, no white cast, wears well under makeup (I don't even notice it), very faint scent. I've tried quite a few but this has been my favorite! "
"Josh Rosebrook's Tinted Day Cream and 14e Cosmetic's Foundation are the two that work best for me - they're both physical sunscreen so I think there is some flashback, but I've found it's pretty minimal, especially with 14e. "
"Another really great option (though it makes me wallet cry) is Chantecaille's Just Skin, which claims to have SPF 15. While it's pretty low, the coverage is so amazing, and there's no flashback whatsoever."
"WORST: Biore UV Perfect Face Milk"
"My skin: NC40-44, extremely oily"
"This is regularly recommended to oily gals on Reddit, so I have to warn those in my range. I wore this during my friend's wedding in hopes that it can make my makeup last a bit longer, but that turned out to  be a bad decision. It gave me a white cast so bad, you can see it in person, not just in flash pictures. I'm olive-skinned, so I'm already greyish, but this amped up the grey and made me look DEAD. I literally look like the floating disembodied head of a ghost in my friend's wedding pics. And it didn't even control my oil."
"BEST? I'm still looking for my HG, but the Hada Labo UV creamy gel is working well for me right now."
